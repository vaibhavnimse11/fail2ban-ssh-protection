# Setup Guide: Fail2Ban to Block SSH Attackers on Debian

This guide explains how to install and configure Fail2Ban on a Debian system to block IP addresses that try to log in with incorrect SSH credentials multiple times.

---

## Step 1: Update Your System
Before installing anything, update the package list:
```bash
sudo apt-get update

 Step 2: Install Fail2Ban
Install the Fail2Ban package using:

######sudo apt-get install fail2ban

 Step 3: Create or Edit Configuration File
Open the jail configuration file:


#######sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
Paste the following inside

[sshd]
enabled = true
port = 22
filter = sshd
backend = systemd
maxretry = 3
bantime = 3600
findtime = 600
Explanation:

enabled = true â†’ Turns on protection for SSH.

port = 22 â†’ Monitors the SSH port.

filter = sshd â†’ Uses SSH logs for matching failed logins.

backend = systemd â†’ Reads logs using systemd journal.

maxretry = 3 â†’ Only 3 failed attempts allowed.

bantime = 3600 â†’ Blocks IP for 1 hour.

findtime = 600 â†’ Checks for 3 failures within 10 minutes.

 Step 4: Restart Fail2Ban Service
To apply the changes:
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
Step 5: Check the Status
To check if it's working and see banned IPs:

sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
You can also use this to list all Fail2Ban jails:


sudo fail2ban-client status
 Step 6: View Blocked IPs (Optional)
To see which IPs are blocked using iptables:

sudo iptables -L --line-numbers


ðŸŽ¯ Result
Now, if anyone tries to access your Debian system using SSH and fails more than 3 times within 10 minutes, Fail2Ban will automatically block that IP for 1 hour.

If you ever want to unban an IP manually, use:

sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <IP_ADDRESS>
